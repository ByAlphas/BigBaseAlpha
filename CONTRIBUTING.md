## 🧪 Testing

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run specific test file
node --test test/bigbase.test.js

# Run with verbose output

```

### Writing Tests
- Place tests in the `test/` directory
- Use the built-in Node.js test runner
- Follow the existing test patterns
- Test both success and error cases
- Include performance tests for critical paths

### Test Coverage

3. **Integration**
   - Ensure compatibility with existing features
   - Test with various configurations
   - Consider plugin interactions

## 🔌 Plugin Development

### Creating Plugins
```javascript
export default {
  name: 'my-plugin',
  version: '1.0.0',
  description: 'Description of my plugin',
  
  async onInit(db) {
    // Initialize plugin
  },
  
  async onWrite(collection, data) {
    // Handle write operations
  }
};
```

### Plugin Guidelines
- Follow the plugin interface
- Handle errors gracefully
- Don't modify core database state directly
- Provide clear documentation
- Include tests for your plugin
